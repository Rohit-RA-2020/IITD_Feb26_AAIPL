Solution to the Liar and the Truth Teller 
By Philip S. Thomas, January 2011 (updated July 2014 and May 2017) 

The solution to the original problem is: “If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, 
what would s/he say?” If you ask the liar, s/he will lie about what the truth-teller would say, and will point 
you to the door that leads to death. The truth teller would tell the truth that the liar would point to the 
door to death. So, both guards would point you towards the door to death, and so you take the other 
door.  

Of course, the question above is not a yes/no question. However, it can easily be converted into one by 
pointing towards a door and asking “If I were to ask the other guard whether this door leads to freedom, 
what would s/he say?” If the response is “yes”, then take the other door. If the response is “no”, then take 
the door that you pointed to. 

For  the  version  with  only  one  guard,  we  as  (in  yes/no  form):  “If  I  were  to  as  you  which  door  goes  to 
freedom, what would you say?”. The truth teller would tell the truth and point you to the door to freedom. 
The liar would lie about what s/he would say if you asked him or her. If you did ask him or her, s/he would 
tell you the door to death, so s/he lies about this and also points you towards the door the freedom. So, 
both types of guard would point you toward the correct door. Since this only uses one guard, this is also 
the solution to the problem with two guards, but where you do not know how many tell the truth and 
how many lie – you just ignore one of the guards.
